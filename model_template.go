You can view and manage your API keys in Settings > Account Management > Integrations > API tokens    API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made to HTTP will fail.   ### Errors:    Invoice Ninja uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. below is a table of standard status codes and responses    | Status Code | Explanation                                                                 |   |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|   | 200         | OK: The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request. |   | 301         | Moved Permanently: This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI. |   | 303         | See Other: The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method. |   | 400         | Bad Request: The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. |   | 401         | Unauthorized: Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. |   | 403         | Forbidden: The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. |   | 404         | Not Found: The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. |   | 405         | Method Not Allowed: A request method is not supported for the requested resource. |   | 409         | Conflict: Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request. |   | 422         | Unprocessable Entity: The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors. |   | 429         | Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\"). |   | 500         | Internal Server Error: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable. |   ### Pagination    When using index routes to retrieve lists of data, by default we limit the number of records returned to 20. You can using standard pagination to paginate results, ie: ?per_page=50
