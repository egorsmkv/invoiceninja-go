    \ Whether you're building a custom client, automating workflows, or integrating\
    \ with other systems, our API provides the tools you need to streamline your invoicing\
    \ and billing processes.\n  ### What is Invoice Ninja?\n  Invoice Ninja is a robust\

    \  </div>\n\n  ### Client Libraries\n\n  PHP SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/invoiceninja/sdk-php)\n\
    \  ### Authentication:\n\n  Invoice Ninja uses API tokens to authenticate requests.\
    \ You can view and manage your API keys in Settings > Account Management > Integrations\
    \ > API tokens\n\n  API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made to HTTP will\
    \ fail.\n  ### Errors:\n\n  Invoice Ninja uses standard HTTP response codes to\
    \ indicate the success or failure of a request. below is a table of standard status\
    \ codes and responses\n\n  | Status Code | Explanation                       \
    \                                          |\n  |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\
    \  | 200         | OK: The request has succeeded. The information returned with\
    \ the response is dependent on the method used in the request. |\n  | 301    \
    \     | Moved Permanently: This and all future requests should be directed to\
    \ the given URI. |\n  | 303         | See Other: The response to the request can\
    \ be found under another URI using the GET method. |\n  | 400         | Bad Request:\
    \ The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client\
    \ error. |\n  | 401         | Unauthorized: Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically\
    \ for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.\
    \ |\n  | 403         | Forbidden: The request was valid, but the server is refusing\
    \ action. |\n  | 404         | Not Found: The requested resource could not be\
    \ found but may be available in the future. |\n  | 405         | Method Not Allowed:\
    \ A request method is not supported for the requested resource. |\n  | 409   \
    \      | Conflict: Indicates that the request could not be processed because of\
    \ conflict in the request. |\n  | 422         | Unprocessable Entity: The request\
    \ was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors. |\n  |\
    \ 429         | Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given\
    \ amount of time (\"rate limiting\"). |\n  | 500         | Internal Server Error:\
    \ A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered\
    \ and no more specific message is suitable. |\n  ### Pagination\n\n  When using\
    \ index routes to retrieve lists of data, by default we limit the number of records\
    \ returned to 20. You can using standard pagination to paginate results, ie: ?per_page=50\n"

        Matching invoices or a payment to a bank transactions.

        The API expects the id of the transaction along with either a comma separated list of invoice ids OR the payment id to associate the transaction to.

        Example for matching a transaction to two invoices:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"olejRl5ejN","invoice_ids":"JxboYBLegw,JxboYBLeXX"}]}

        Example for matching a transaction and a paymente:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"olejRl5ejN","payment_id":"JxboYBLeXf"}]}

        Matching expenses.

        You can match an existing expense within Invoice Ninja - or - create a new expense using the following:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"open5pld7A","vendor_id":"gl9avJnaG1","ninja_category_id":""}]}

        To match to an existing expense:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"Jxbo2qKagw","expense_id":"7N1aMM1aWm"}]}

        ##  GET /api/v1/locations

        Locations are additional addresses that are applicable to a client. This is useful when a client has multiple addresses for shipping, billing, etc.

        When retrieving a list of locations you can chain query parameters to filter the dataset. For example:

        ```html
        /api/v1/locations?name=warehouse*
        ```

        You can also sort the results:

        ```html
        /api/v1/locations?sort=name|desc
        ```

        For pagination, use per_page and page parameters:

        ```html
        /api/v1/locations?per_page=15&page=2
        ```

        The default per_page value is 20.

      description: "##  GET /api/v1/clients  \nWhen retrieving a list of clients you\
        \ can also chain query parameters in order to filter the dataset that is returned.\
        \ For example, you can send a request to the following URL to retrieve clients\
        \ that have a balance greater than 1000\n  \n```\n/api/v1/clients?balance=gt:1000\n\
        ``` \n\nYou can also sort the results by adding a sort parameter. The following\
        \ example will sort the results by the client name in descending order\n\n\
        ```\n/api/v1/clients?sort=name|desc\n```\n\nYou can also combine multiple\
        \ filters together. The following example will return clients that have a\
        \ balance greater than 1000 and are not deleted and have a name that starts\
        \ with \"Bob\"\n\n```\n/api/v1/clients?balance=gt:1000&name=Bob*\n```\n\n\
        If you wish to retrieve child relations, you can also combine the query parameter\
        \ `?include=` with a comma separated list of relationships\n\n```\n/api/v1/clients?include=activities,ledger,system_logs'\n\
        ```\n\nThe per_page and page variables allow pagination of the list of clients.\
        \ The following example will return the second page of clients with 15 clients\
        \ per page\n\n```\n/api/v1/clients?per_page=15&page=2\n```\n\nThe default\

        ##  POST /api/v1/clients/bulk

        Bulk actions allow to make changes to multiple clients in a single request the following actions are supported

        - archive
        - restore
        - delete
        - template _requires template,template_id properties also_
        - assign_group _requires group_settings_id also_
        - bulk_update _requires column,new_value also_

        All of these actions require an array of client ids to perform the requested action on ie.

        "ids":['id1','id2']

        actions such as template, assign_group and bulk_update also require additional properties to be passed in the request

        - template

        The template bulk action allows the creation of a custom template using the provided template_id to be run against the array of clients provided.

        - assign_group

        Allows setting multiple clients to a single group

        - bulk_update

        Allows updating certain columns on the client model in bulk. the current list of supported columns that can be updated archived_at:

        - public_notes
        - industry_id
        - size_id
        - country_id
